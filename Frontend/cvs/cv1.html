              <p id="statement">After trying my hand at project management and planning engineering, I came to the realization that my true passion lay in problem solving and tech. I decided to enrol at Makers Academy on their 12 week intensive programming and web development course. It has been exhilarating, exhausting, frustrating and fun. I’m now looking for a full time role as a Junior Developer in a place I can expand my skills, commit to the projects at hand and learn to write great code which solve real world problems.</p>
