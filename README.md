# someDesignPrincipals

Used an old index file to work around building a responsive design project

Many errors made and learnt from, including how difficult it is to design a website on the fly which is also of a high standard - NEVER AGAIN!!! will leave it to the design professionals in future or use a free template, and stick to what I know and love, Coding.
